This Project is basically a Application of our Project [Aatmanirbhar Sanchar](https://github.com/BE-Project-VESIT-AatmaSanchar/Aatmanirbhar-Sanchar)

    Using our encryption process, we have developed an auto synchronization file app useful in situations where the user repeatedly stores important readings in the format of a file in a selected directory and wants to securely upload
    the same to a remote server automatically when a new file comes in that particular directory.

This part of Repository contains the Map Based Tracking code of the application.

Server Side code of the same can be found [here](https://github.com/BE-Project-VESIT-AatmaSanchar/Auto-File-Sync-App-Server)

Along with the file, the current location coordinates of the user are also sent which is then used to display a
tracking history on a [web-based map UI](http://file.aatmanirbhar-sanchar.live/) for easy analysis Along with various filters for ease of use
